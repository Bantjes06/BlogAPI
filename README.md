# BlogAPI
This site was created for using my own API that I created for practice.
Run npm i to install all packages required
in the terminal run node ./index.js to start the server of the API at port 4000.
in a new terminal run node ./server.js to start the website at port 3000 then in your browser, open localhost:3000
