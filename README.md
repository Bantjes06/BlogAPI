# BlogAPI
This site was created for using my own API that I created for practice.
To view website, firstly run npm i to install all packages.
The API is saved in index.js, run node ./index.js to start the server which is on port 4000.
In a new terminal run node ./server.js which runs on port 3000. To view the website you must then open localhost:3000 in your chosen browser.
